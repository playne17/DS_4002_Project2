# DS 4002 Project 1

## For our Second project, we are testing the following hypothesis: The Port of Long Beach is on average busier than The Port of San Francisco. Our hypothesis is motivated by the desire to better understand the American supply chain. To help navigate our repository, adhere to the following sections. The "SOURCE" section shows how we install, build, and use our code. The "DATA" folder will enable you to see our data dictionary, a link to the Kaggle source, and notes about how we use the data. The "FIGURES" folder contains all of the figures produced and summarizes the takeaways. The "REFERENCES" section acknowledges the sources for our analysis. 

## SRC 
### Installing / Building Code
The primary reference code for preparing the data for Naive Bayes can be found here:

### Usage of Code
After building the Naive Bayes model, it will necessary to scrape data from Glassdoor to run it through the model. We used code from the following source:
